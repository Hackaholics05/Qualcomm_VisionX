# Reflection Removal with U-Net

This repository implements a deep learning model to remove reflections from images using a **U-Net** architecture. The model is trained on pairs of images: one with reflections and one clear (without reflections). The trained model can be used to remove reflections from new images.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to create a model that can take an image with unwanted reflections (such as reflections from glass or water surfaces) and output a version of the image with the reflections removed. This is useful for applications like image enhancement, medical imaging, and surveillance.

### Key Features:
- **U-Net architecture** for reflection removal.
- **Data augmentation** using Keras' `ImageDataGenerator` for improving model generalization.
- **Training using reflection and clear image pairs**.

## Requirements

Before running the code, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

- **TensorFlow** (for building and training the model)
- **NumPy** (for handling image arrays)
- **OpenCV** (for reading and resizing images)
- **Matplotlib** (for visualizing the results)
- **os** (for managing file paths)

You can install the required libraries using:

```bash
pip install tensorflow numpy opencv-python matplotlib
```

## Setup and Usage

### 1. **Prepare Your Dataset**
   - You need to prepare a dataset with two sets of images:
     - **Images with reflections** (e.g., images containing glass or water reflections).
     - **Clear images** (the corresponding clean version without reflections).
   - The dataset should be structured as follows:
     ```
     Dataset/
       ├── img with reflection/
       │   ├── image1.jpg
       │   ├── image2.jpg
       │   └── ...
       └── clear/
           ├── image1.jpg
           ├── image2.jpg
           └── ...
     ```

### 2. **Modify the Dataset Path**
   In the code, adjust the following paths to match your dataset directory structure:

   ```python
   base_dir = 'Dataset/Dataset'
   clear_dir = os.path.join(base_dir, 'clear')
   reflection_dir = os.path.join(base_dir, 'img with reflection')
   ```

### 3. **Model Architecture**
   The model is a **U-Net** architecture, commonly used for image segmentation tasks. The encoder captures context, while the decoder reconstructs the image while removing the reflection.

### 4. **Training the Model**
   To train the model, run the provided script. The training function uses the `data_generator` to load batches of reflection images and clear images for training.

   The training code:
   ```python
   history = model.fit(train_gen, epochs=num_epochs, steps_per_epoch=steps_per_epoch)
   ```

   Here, `num_epochs` specifies how many times the model will iterate over the entire training dataset, and `steps_per_epoch` determines how many steps (batches) are processed per epoch.

### 5. **Save the Model**
   After training, the model will be saved to disk:

   ```python
   model.save('reflection_removal_unet.h5')
   ```

   This allows you to reuse the trained model later for inference on new images.

### 6. **Using the Trained Model for Inference**
   After training, you can use the saved model to predict reflections in new images by loading it using the following code:

   ```python
   model = tf.keras.models.load_model('reflection_removal_unet.h5')
   ```

   Once the model is loaded, you can pass new images through it to remove reflections.

## Training Parameters

- **Batch size**: 16
- **Number of epochs**: 50
- **Steps per epoch**: `len(X_train) // batch_size`

You can adjust the batch size, number of epochs, and other training parameters based on your dataset size and computational resources.

## Model Summary

The U-Net architecture consists of:
1. **Encoder (downsampling)**: This part captures the spatial features of the input image.
2. **Bottleneck**: A deep convolutional block that processes the compressed features.
3. **Decoder (upsampling)**: This part reconstructs the image and reduces the reflection noise.

The model ends with a **3-channel output** (RGB) image, which is expected to be the original image with reflections removed.

## Notes

- Ensure that your training dataset is clean and well-aligned between the reflections and clear images.
- You can further improve model performance with additional data augmentation or using more advanced techniques like pre-trained models.
